          <p class="main-content-p">Hey there, <br><br>
           I am a German national who relocated to South Africa in 2010. I received my South African Matric as well as my German Abitur.
           After school I moved to Germany and completed my apprenticeship as car mechanic. 

           I am highly self motivated and I will not stop until I have the answer that I need. 
           I love solving problems and therefore like to challenge myself.

           My dream job would Software Engineering, since this is in line with my personal strengths.
